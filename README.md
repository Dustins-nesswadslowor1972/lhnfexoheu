Wow, just got done with Alarum, and man, I'm like all over the place right now. It’s like, you know when you eat something spicy and you’re like, “Am I enjoying this or am I just in pain?” Yeah, that. 😂 For real though, I didn’t expect the plot to go there at all. It was like, one moment we're chillin', thinking it's all good, and then BAM, everything flips. Who writes this stuff? A wizard with too much coffee, probably.

So, there’s this one scene—no spoilers I swear—where I literally just sat there like, How did we even get here? Still processing the whole thing. Honestly, you gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see what I mean. It’s like you think it's one thing, but then it's a whole different animal. But don’t blame me if it messes with your sleep tonight. 😂

> Anyway, the acting tho... like, some were killing it (props!), and then buddy over there with zero expression, just... existing? I mean, c’mon, give me something! At some points, I wondered if they were more surprised than the audience about their lines. Kinda hilarious but also, dude, it's your job!

Halfway through, I was thinking I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again ‘cause maybe I missed some subtle clues or whatever, but also, not sure I have the emotional stability for round two right now. 😅 It’s like when you wanna re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a sports game even though your team lost, just to see where it all went wrong. Oh, and the soundtrack was a bop, like it had no business being that good!

if (mindBlown) { keepThinking(); } // idk why but felt relevant lol

Anyway, catch it when you can. Hit me up after and we’ll dissect this beast like it's bio lab all over again. Gonna need another brain to throw around all my wild theories with. Okay, I need to stop rambling. Chat later.
